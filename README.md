Exploratory Data Analysis on Amazon Product Review Dataset using Excel
# Amazon Product Reviews EDA 📊

Welcome to my first case study in Excel-based Exploratory Data Analysis. This project analyzes Amazon product and review data to uncover trends in pricing, discounts, ratings, review patterns, and potential revenue.

---

## 🛠️ Goals
- Analyze discount trends by product category  
- Investigate rating and review volume relationships  
- Visualize results with dynamic dashboards in Excel  
- Derive actionable business insights from the data

---

## 📈 Key Features
1. **Average Discount % by Category** – Identifying which categories receive the best deals  
2. **Total Potential Revenue by Category** – Calculated as Actual Price × Review Count  
3. **Rating Distribution** – Visual breakdown of how products are rated  
4. **Product Count per Price Range** – Understanding product affordability tiers  
5. **KPI Card** – Summarizing key numbers:
   - Total Products: 1,465

## 💡 Insights & Findings
- Discount levels vary widely across categories, with some receiving over 50% discounts  
- A significant number of products are priced under ₹200  
- Higher review volume contributes disproportionately to potential revenue  
- No clear correlation between discount size and product rating, revealing complexity in customer behavior

---

## 🧰 Tools & Techniques
- Microsoft Excel: PivotTables, PivotCharts, slicers, number formats  
- Formulas used: `COUNTIF`, `SUM`, `AVERAGE`, nested `IF`, `COUNTA`  
- Dashboard creation skills: Layout design, interactive slicers, KPI card formatting

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Embed this dashboard into my professional portfolio  
- Apply similar analysis to other e-commerce datasets  
- Explore more sophisticated tools (Power BI, Python)
